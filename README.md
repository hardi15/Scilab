# Scilab
This repo contains some scilab programs which I've added as I learn them as a part of Signals and Systems course.

# Topics
* Inbuilt normal functions (sine, cosine)
* Distortion and noise of inbuilt functions
* Building your own functions for line, pulse, etc
* Convolution and Correlation of Functions
* Different kinds of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT)
